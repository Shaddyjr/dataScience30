    "Data is information, and information is power. It would not be out of line to say once you're equipped with data science as a tool, you will be capable of doing real harm if you are not taking cautionary steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea that has gained traction is the need for a kind of \"Hippocratic Oath\" for data scientists.  \n",
    "The \"Hippocratic Oath\" is a pledge that medical professionals, like doctors, take stating they will \"do no harm\". There currently is no such pledge or oath for data scientist, but [a preliminary code of conduct is in the works](https://data.berkeley.edu/news/it%E2%80%99s-time-data-ethics-conversations-your-dinner-table), which will take time for the industry and tought leaders to come to a concensus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I bring this up because data is dangerous in the wrong hands, and I would be doing you, and the world, a disservice if I gave you a knife and only showed you HOW to use it without showing you WHEN to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Disclaimer_: By no means am I an expert on ethics! The topics discussed may provoke strong emotions and I encourage anyone taking this course to reflect on how you might view each situation from different perspectives. __This is NOT about right vs. wrong.__ These exercises are meant to spark the inner dialogue and self criticism any good scientist should have when deciding on WHEN to use the tools at their disposal.\n",

    "#### Scenario 1 - Predicting Recidivism - ([source](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)):\n",
    "In criminal courts, judges are responsible for deciding everything from bail, to probation, to parole. Of course, judges are human and statistical analysis has consistently shown judges biased - particularly regarding race.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your company decides to help remove this bias by creating a machine learning model and training it on criminal data, which will NOT include race as part of its prediction, thereby removing that bias. You and your team make a model that can accurately predict _recidivism_, the likelihood a criminal will become a repeat offender, by giving a defendant a risk score. __This model will NOT decide on bail, probation, or parole__ - it will merely serve as a tool for judges to consider when making their decision. Judges will still have the ultimate decision in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "After employing the model, criminals from a minority background consistently have higher risk scores than other groups. Judges use this information to help make their decisions.\n",
