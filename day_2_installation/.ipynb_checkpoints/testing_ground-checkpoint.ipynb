    "Jupyter notebooks will be the main tool we'll be using throughout this course. __Spending time learning how to use this tool now will save a lot of later!__ The following tasks are by far the most common, so you'll want to commit these keyboard shortcuts to muscle memory.\n",

    "While in a Jupyter notebook, near the top navigate to \"Help > Keyboard Shortcuts\". Use these shortcuts to complete the following tasks WITHOUT touching your mouse:\n",
    "- Create 2 new cell above the current cell\n",
    "- Create 2 new cell below the current cell\n",
    "- Delete one of the newly created cells\n",
    "- Convert 1 cell to Markdown\n",
    "    - Write a few lines of content in the Markdown cell\n",
    "    - _NOTE: You should have at least 2 code cells and 1 Markdown cells after this point_\n",
    "- Split the markdown cell from the previous cell roughly in half\n",
    "- In one code cell write `x = 5`, and in __another__ code cell, write `y = 10`\n",

    "There are a number of great widgets for Jupyter Notebooks called [nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I highly recommend downloading the package in Anaconda and browsing to see which extensions you might want to use. I personally love the \"Sketchpad\"!\n",

    "Markdown can seem intimidating at first, but knowing even a little markdown syntax can drastically improve the readability of your code. Check out this [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) and get familiar with at least 5-6 markdown elements."
